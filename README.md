# Full-Stack Project, Back-End README
## GA Boston WDI28 Project 2
## By: Eshan Misra

### Project Approach

This was my second project at GA, and the first time building both a back-end api and a front-end client.

My idea for the project was to build an IMDb of sorts; allow users to look up information about film directors, and also be able to add/edit/delete directors of their own (once signed in).

### Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* AJAX
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Handlebars


### Planning/Building Process

* Build/scaffold my resource (directors)
* Connect user to directors api (user ownership/directors belong to)
* Build/test CRUDs one at a time
* Create front-end client
* Test front-end auth functionality, one function at a time (sign up/in/out, change password)
* Test front-end resource functionality, one function at a time (add/edit/delete director)
* Add styling to front-end

### Future Improvements/Plans

In the future, I would ideally like to improve the overall aesthetics of the client, adjusting the sizing/spacing of the forms (sign in/up, change password, etc) and message fields. Also add complimentary functionality for including movies if/when I improve my back-end to include a movies table.
